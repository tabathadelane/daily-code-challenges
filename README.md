Daily small code challenges that I use to practice pseudocoding and problem solving for interview prep. After spending weeks working with big frameworks like Vue, Django, and Sass, I have realized I am having to Google search more of the simple programming syntax than I feel comfortable with. 


Github suggested I call this Repo "bug-free-rotary-phone," and I was really tempted. It's not quite what I'm looking for right now. I just really think that is worth remembering. This just reminds me that one of the names suggested for my kitten a few years ago by one of my pizza cooks was Ricotta. Sometimes we still call her "The Cat That Was Almost Named Ricotta." We named her Zelda instead. She is a princess and she knows it. 6 months later we adopted another cat and named him Data (The Star Trek one). We sometimes joke that if his sister was named Ricotta, a great name for him would be Peppadew. We don't regret our decision. 

Ask me about my cats for +1 relatability.
